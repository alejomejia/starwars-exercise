## How to run locally

1. Clone the repository using `https://github.com/alejomejia/starwars-exercise.git`, `git@github.com:alejomejia/starwars-exercise.git` or download manually
2. To run this project, you're gonna need Node v18. I'd suggest you to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script), it's a node version manager that you can use to install separate node versions locally in the repository. It's pretty straightforward, just run the command in the terminal to install it in your computer and that's it.
3. Make sure `nvm` was installed running `nvm -v` in the console, it must return the current version.
4. Now go the project folder and run `nvm i && npm i` to install Node v18 and all the project dependencies.
5. Run `npm run build && npm run start` to check it locally
